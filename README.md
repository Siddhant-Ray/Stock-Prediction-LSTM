# Stock-Prediction-LSTM

A neural networks based model have been used in predicting of the stock market. One of the methods, as an intelligent data mining, is artificial neural network (ANN). In this project represents how to predict a NASDAQ's stock value using ANNs with a given input parameters of share market. We used real exchange rate value of NASDAQ Stock Market index. This project makes use generalized Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM).
